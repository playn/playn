/**
 * Defines and dispatches keyboard events. Three events are generated by keyboard input:
 * <ul>
 * <li> When any key is depressed, a {@link KeyEvent} is emitted indicating the logical key that
 * was depressed. </li>
 * <li> If the depressed key also corresponds to a printable character ('c' for example, but not
 * shift or alt), a {@link TypedEvent} is emitted to inform the app of the typed character. The
 * typed character will account for whether the shift key is depressed and will be appropriately
 * mapped to the uppercase equivalent or the appropriate alternate character (for example, # for 3,
 * in the US keyboard layout). The typed event is delivered immediately after the pressed event.
 * </li>
 * <li> When a key is released, a {@link KeyEvent} is emitted, indicating the logical key that was
 * released. </li>
 * </ul>
